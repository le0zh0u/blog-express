Recently, I Read a book named *Node.js实战*. It is written by *赵坤* and more. In the book, The first chapter is How to use Express and MongoDB to build multi-poeple blog. 
But when I copy from the book, I still get stuck. So I write it down and put the solutions here.

### Use MongoDB

##### What is MongoDB
    
> MongoDB(from humongous) is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database.Classified as a NoSQL database, MongoDB avoids the traditional table-based relational database structure in favor of JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas(MongoDB calls the format BSON), making the intergration of data incertain types of applications easier and faster. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and is free and open-source, published under a combination of the GNU Affero General Public License and the Apache License.

Wikipedia say it.
